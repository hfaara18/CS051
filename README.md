# Programs-with-ObjectDraw

**[Objectdraw](http://eventfuljava.cs.williams.edu/library/objectdrawJavadocV1.1.1/)**  is a java library that simplifies
the construction of programs that draw elementary graphics and interact primarily by reacting to mouse events 
such as clicking and dragging.

##  Programs
2D programs were made with objectdraw in order to get an understanding of Object Orieted Programming in Java, and 
to develop my ability to design versatile algorithms.

* ##  [Apples](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Apples)
  ** A rendition of the Hangman ame that drops apple after after the player makes wrong letter guesses to **
  **  an unknow word  **
  
* ##  [BoxBall](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/BoxBall)
  ** A simple game that allows the player to drop a ball into a box from a predetermined distance based **
  ** on the user's desired difficulty setting **
  
* ##  [Exploding](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Exploding)
  ** A simple game that creates a rapidly expanding circle which shrinks or continues expanding after the user **
  ** on the screen **

* ##  [Frogger](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Frogger)
  ** A rendition of the frogger game where the player is supposed to controll a frog to cross a road **
  ** without a vehicle passing over it **

* ##  [Laundry](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Laundry)
  **  A simple game where the player drags a laundry of a random color to its designated basket **

* ##[LightBalloon](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/LightBalloon)
  **  A simple game where the color of two balloons are determined by the relative positions of **
  ** three red, green, and blue colored bulbs. The player can only move the bulbs **

* ##  [Nibbles](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Nibbles)
  **  A simple rendition of the snake game **

* ##  [NoClicking](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/NoClicking)

  ** A simple rendition of the skiball game **

* ##  [Snowman](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Snowman)
  ** An attempt to create a snowman with basic 2d shapes **

* ##  [Stairs](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Stairs)
  ** A recursive script that creatse a moveable/ draggable staircase **

* ##  [TextPlay](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/TextPlay)
  ** A game that modifies user texts using preset values associated with button presses **

* ##  [Triangulate](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/Triangulate)
  **  A recursive script that create a moveable/ draggable multicolored array of rectangles **

* ##  [WindowManager](https://github.com/hfaara18/Programs-with-ObjectDraw/tree/master/WindowManager)
